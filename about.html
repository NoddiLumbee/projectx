                <h1>Personal Statement </h1>
                <hr>
                <p>I was born in Thailand and I live in the blood of Thai people. It has been a challenge for me to expose myself to a school full of international students. But that is the only way that I will grow, and I believe it would be the best way. </p>

                <p>Over time I started to realize the importance of perceiving problems as a tool for learning, as a step that will lead me to a successful life. Without life obstacles, your success story will be dull.</p>

                <p>My life is very satisfying. I lived with cousins in a big family so we always have friends. Luckily, my house is supportive of playing sports, I have a strong body and good physical appearances. Due to the fact that I am fulfilled and happy most of the time, I start seeking out the purpose of living other than my happiness. One day during my holiday, I got the answers to my question. I learned a lesson that helping other people is the shortcut to a happy and meaningful life and it was when I realized my purpose of living.</p>

                <p>Also, by listening to different speakers in TED Talks, I learned more about choosing a career. One guy in TED talks said “Over 90% of teenagers love to play basketball but only 5% of basketball careers are available.”. What this does mean is that things you love do not bring you to that job. Then what would be the job you desire to do in the future? The answer is straightaway, said that guy, the best source of happiness is giving. To conclude, what job in the future does not matter if it is valuable to the world and able to solve people’s problems.</p>

                <p>Before going too far, back to my current position as a student. How far will it take for me to achieve that dream of mine, 5 years? 10 years? Without a clear goal, I will not be motivated so I have set myself the goal to help 100 people to solve their problems by the end of year 2020. After I have talked about life, I would like to pinpoint my feeling one day in my holiday, honestly, I felt like I lost the purpose of living, living just for the comfort of your own just doesn’t feel enough for me, it doesn’t mean very much and that is the moment I realize what I should do. The meaning of my life is for the sake of others. The ones who are out there waiting, keep waiting, and still waiting for kindhearted people to help.</p>

                <p>This is where I will learn business alongside other life skills in my own time. The reason I chose to learn business is because business will give me overarching knowledge about the business worlds, the economy, the mindsets and once I have a clear knowledge on doing business, I’m sure I will be able to leverage that and combine with the skills I obtain alongside to create the most beneficial gift to the world citizens and bringing them back to the world of happiness.</p>

                <p>What I do currently before applying to business university is by picking a business subject as my major curriculum and we have sbeen working on the project of helping real business, real companies to solve their problem and make decisions by applying our knowledge we learned to it. Additionally, at home, I have recently put myself into the stock market and started investing my savings into it. This is a good opportunity for me to apply skills and knowledge from the school and extra studies in assessing real company performances and analyzing trends and growth as well as its attractiveness in investing measure from the return on investment I predicted to receive.
